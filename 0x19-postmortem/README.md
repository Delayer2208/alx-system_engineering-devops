Postmortem Report for Outage Incident
Issue Summary
Duration of Outage:
Start Time: June 20, 2024, 2:00 PM (UTC)
End Time: June 20, 2024, 4:30 PM (UTC)

Impact:
Our primary e-commerce platform experienced significant slowdowns and intermittent downtime during this period. Users were unable to complete purchases or access product pages. Approximately 75% of our users were affected, resulting in a potential loss of revenue and a spike in customer service complaints.

Root Cause:
A misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to uneven distribution of traffic, causing server overload and service degradation.

Timeline
2:00 PM: Issue detected via automated monitoring alerts indicating high server response times.
2:05 PM: Engineers began investigating the alerts; initial assumption was a traffic spike.
2:15 PM: Further monitoring showed that server load was unevenly distributed.
2:30 PM: Misleading path: team initially suspected a DDoS attack and activated the DDoS mitigation plan.
3:00 PM: Realized that the load balancer settings were recently changed during a routine update.
3:10 PM: Incident escalated to the network engineering team.
3:30 PM: Identified and confirmed the misconfiguration in the load balancer.
4:00 PM: Reverted the load balancer settings to the previous configuration.
4:15 PM: System performance began to stabilize; monitoring confirmed normal operation.
4:30 PM: Officially declared the incident resolved.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. During a routine update, a configuration change inadvertently caused the load balancer to distribute traffic unevenly. This led to some servers being overwhelmed with requests while others were underutilized.

Resolution:
To resolve the issue, the network engineering team reverted the load balancer configuration to its previous state. This involved restoring the original settings that evenly distributed traffic across all servers. Once the settings were reverted, the system gradually returned to normal operation as server loads balanced out.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements and Fixes:

Configuration Review Process: Implement a more rigorous review process for configuration changes. All changes should be peer-reviewed and tested in a staging environment before deployment.
Enhanced Monitoring: Improve monitoring to include specific alerts for load balancer misconfigurations. This can help detect issues faster and avoid misleading paths in future investigations.
Automated Rollback: Develop automated rollback scripts for critical components like load balancers. This ensures a quicker response time in reverting changes that cause issues.
Training and Documentation: Conduct training sessions for the engineering team on the impact of load balancer configurations and document the standard operating procedures for making such changes.
Task List:

 Implement a peer-review process for configuration changes.
 Enhance monitoring tools to include load balancer-specific alerts.
 Develop and test automated rollback scripts for load balancer configurations.
 Schedule training sessions for engineers on load balancer configurations.
 Update documentation with new standard operating procedures and troubleshooting guides.
By addressing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure a more robust and reliable service for our users.
